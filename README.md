# Sandbox: Meteor Users Angular Client-Side 

The aim of this project is to find the most effective structure for a simple social network using:

- Meteor.js
- The accounts-password meteor package
- AngularJS on client side
- [Angular-Meteor](https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor) for getting the above to play nice.

## Features

Users have

- static fields
- friends - a list of users

On the client side, one can

- access user profiles
- live search through all users, or friends of a particular user

Since we're using the account-password package, one can easily add registration UI using the accounts-ui package.

## Running

Clone the repository, cd into the root directory, and run

```
meteor
```
Default port is 3000
